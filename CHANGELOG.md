    let write: Completable = dbQueue.rx.write { db in
        try Player(...).insert(db)
    }
    
    let newPlayerCount: Single<Int> = dbQueue.rx.writeAndReturn { db in
        try Player(...).insert(db)
        return try Player.fetchCount(db)

        try Player.fetchAll(db)
    }
    ```

### Breaking Changes

- Observation methods have been renamed from `fetch...` to `observe...`:
    
    ```diff
    -Player.all().rx.fetchOne(in: dbQueue)
    -Player.all().rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
    -Player.all().rx.fetchCount(in: dbQueue)
    +Player.all().rx.observeFirst(in: dbQueue)
    +Player.all().rx.observeAll(in: dbQueue)
    +Player.all().rx.observeCount(in: dbQueue)
    ```

- The way to provide a specific scheduler to a value observable has changed:
    
    ```diff
    -Player.all().rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue, scheduler: MainScheduler.asyncInstance)
    +Player.all().rx.observeAll(in: dbQueue, observeOn: MainScheduler.asyncInstance)
    ```


## 0.14.0

- Reactive extension on DatabaseRegionObservation:
    
    ```swift
    let players = Player.all()
    let teams = Team.all()
    let observation = DatabaseRegionObservation(tracking: players, teams)
    observation.rx.changes(in: dbQueue)
        .subscribe(onNext: { db: Database in
            print("Players or teams have changed.")
        })
    ```

### Breaking Changes

- Swift 4.0 and Swift 4.1 are no longer supported.
- GRDB 3 and RxSwift 4 are no longer supported.
- iOS 8 is no longer supported. Minimum deployment target is now iOS 9.0.
- Deprecated APIs are no longer available.
- `DatabaseWriter.rx.changes` is removed, replaced with `DatabaseRegionObservation.rx.changes`.
- SQLCipher support is now available under the CocoaPods `RxGRDB/SQLCipher` name.


## 0.13.0

Released November 2, 2018 &bull; [diff](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/compare/v0.12.1...v0.13.0)

- [#46](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/pull/46): Implement RxGRDB on top GRDB.ValueObservation


### Breaking Changes

- The `DatabaseWriter.rx.fetch` method has been removed. Instead, use [`ValueObservation.rx.fetch`](README.md#valueobservationrxfetchinstartimmediatelyscheduler).
- The `distinctUntilChanged` parameter is no longer available when one creates an RxGRDB observable. Filtering of consecutive identical database values is now the default behavior.


### New

- One can now create a [values observable](README.md#values-observables) from a [DatabaseReader](https://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/3.5/Protocols/DatabaseReader.html).


## 0.12.1

Released October 25, 2018 &bull; [diff](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/compare/v0.12.0...v0.12.1)

- Fixed GRDB Cocoapods dependency.


## 0.12.0

Released Septembre 17, 2018 &bull; [diff](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/compare/v0.11.0...v0.12.0)

- [#39](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/pull/39): Xcode 10 & GRDB 3.3.0


## 0.11.0

Released June 7, 2018 &bull; [diff](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0)

### New

- Support for GRDB 3.0
- The new DatabaseRegionConvertible protocol allows better request encapsulation ([documentation](README.md#databaseregionconvertible-protocol))

### Breaking Changes

- "Fetch tokens" and the `mapFetch` operator were ill-advised, and have been removed. Now please use the new `DatabaseWriter.fetch(from:startImmediately:scheduler:values:)` method instead, which produces exactly the same observable:
    
    ```diff
     // Old way
    -let values = dbQueue.rx
    -    .fetchTokens(in: [request, ...])
    -    .mapFetch { db in
    -        try fetchResults(db)
    -    }
     
     // New way
    +let values = dbQueue.rx.fetch(from: [request, ...]) { db in
    +    try fetchResults(db)
    +}
    ```


## 0.10.0

Released March 26, 2018 &bull; [diff](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0)


### New

- Unless they are provided an explicit scheduler, [values observables](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/blob/master/README.md#values-observables) subscribed from the main queue are now guaranteed a synchronous emission of their initial value ([#28](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/pull/28)).

- The RxGRDB repository now uses CocoaPods for its inner dependencies GRBD and RxSwift. After you have downloaded the RxGRDB repository, run `pod repo update; pod install` in order to download all dependencies, build targets, or run tests ([#29](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/pull/29)).


### Documentation Diff

- The [Values Observables](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/blob/master/README.md#values-observables) chapter now describes the scheduling of fetched values.


## 0.9.0

Released February 25, 2018 &bull; [diff](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/compare/v0.8.1...v0.9.0)


### New

- [Values observables](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/blob/master/README.md#values-observables) can now be scheduled on any RxSwift scheduler (fixes [#22](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/issues/22)).


### Breaking Changees

- "Change Tokens" have been renamed "Fetch Tokens" in order to better reflect their purpose, and to enhance the distinction between observables that emit values on any schedulers ("values observables") and have "fetch" in their definition, from observables that emit database connections on a GRDB dispatch queue ("changes observables") and have "changes" in their definition).


### Documentation Diff

- The [Scheduling Guide](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/blob/master/README.md#scheduling) has been augmented with a chapter on data consistency.


### API diff

```diff
+struct FetchToken { }
-struct ChangeToken { }

 extension Reactive where Base: DatabaseWriter {
+    func fetchTokens(in requests: [Request], startImmediately: Bool = true, scheduler: ImmediateSchedulerType = MainScheduler.instance) -> Observable<FetchToken>
-    func changeTokens(in requests: [Request], startImmediately: Bool = true, scheduler: ImmediateSchedulerType = MainScheduler.instance) -> Observable<ChangeToken>
 }
```


## 0.8.1

Released February 20, 2018 &bull; [diff](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1)

- Fixes a bug that would have [values observables](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/blob/master/README.md#values-observables) fail to observe some database changes.


## 0.8.0

Released January 18, 2018 &bull; [diff](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0)

This version enhances the scheduling of database notifications, and the tracking of specific database rows.


## New

- The tracking of requests that target specific rows, identified by their row ids, has been enhanced:
    
    In previous version of RxGRDB, tracking `Player.filter(key: 1)` would trigger change notifications for all changes to the players table.
    
    Now RxGRDB is able to precisely track the player of ID 1, and won't emit any notification for changes performed on other players.


## Fixed

- RxGRDB observables used to require subscription and observation to happen on the same dispatch queue. It was easy to fail this precondition, and misuse the library. This has been fixed.
- The [demo application](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/tree/master/Documentation/RxGRDBDemo) used to misuse MKMapView by converting database changes into annotation coordinate updates on the wrong dispatch queue. This has been fixed.


### Breaking Changes

- GRDB dependency has been bumped to v2.6.
- Database observation scheduling used to be managed through raw dispatch queues. One now uses regular [RxSwift schedulers](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/blob/master/Documentation/Schedulers.md). The `synchronizedStart` parameter has been renamed to `startImmediately` in order to reflect the fact that not all schedulers can start synchronously. See the updated [documentation](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/blob/master/README.md#documentation) of RxGRDB reactive methods.
- The `Diffable` protocol was ill-advised, and has been removed.
- The `primaryKeySortedDiff` operator has been replaced by `PrimaryKeyDiffScanner` ([documentation](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/blob/master/README.md#primarykeydiffscanner))

## 0.7.0

Released October 18, 2017 &bull; [diff](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0)

### New

- Support for Swift 4
- Support for various diff algorithms ([Documentation](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/blob/master/README.md#diffs))
- New [demo application](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/tree/master/Documentation/RxGRDBDemo) for various diff algorithms.

### Fixed

- Observables that emit fetched values used to emit their first element on the wrong dispatch queue when their `synchronizedStart` option is true. That first element is now correctly emitted on the subscription dispatch queue.

### Breaking Changes

- Requirements have changed: Xcode 9+, Swift 4, GRDB 2.0


## 0.6.0

Released July 13, 2017

- **Fixed**: Support for macOS, broken in v0.5.0
- **New**: GRDB dependency bumped to v1.2


## 0.5.0

Released July 8, 2017

### New

RxGRDB has learned how to observe multiple requests and fetch from other requests. [Documentation](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB/blob/master/README.md#observing-multiple-requests)

To get a single notification when a transaction has modified several requests, use `DatabaseWriter.rx.changes`:

```swift
// Observable<Database>
dbQueue.rx.changes(in: [request, ...])
```

To turn a change notification into consistent results fetched from multiple requests, use `DatabaseWriter.rx.changeTokens` and the `mapFetch` operator:

```swift
dbQueue.rx
    .changeTokens(in: [request, ...])
    .mapFetch { (db: Database) in
        return ...
    }
```

### API diff

```diff
+extension Reactive where Base: DatabaseWriter {
+    func changes(in requests: [Request], synchronizedStart: Bool = true) -> Observable<Database>
+    func changeTokens(in requests: [Request], synchronizedStart: Bool = true) -> Observable<ChangeToken>
+}

+struct ChangeToken {
+    var database: Database { get }
+}

+extension ObservableType where E == ChangeToken {
+    func func mapFetch<R>(resultQueue: DispatchQueue = DispatchQueue.main, _ fetch: @escaping (Database) throws -> R) -> Observable<R>
+}
```

Released June 20, 2017

### Breaking Changes

- RxGRDB now requires GRDB v1.0


## 0.3.0

Released May 22, 2017

### New

- The new `distinctUntilChanged` parameter has RxGRDB avoid notifying consecutive identical values.

    ```swift
    request.rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue, distinctUntilChanged: true)...
    ```

- Tracking of requests that fetch an array of optional values:
    
    ```swift
    // Email column may be NULL:
    let request = Person.select(email).bound(to: Optional<String>.self)
    request.rx.fetchAll(in: dbQueue)
        .subscribe(onNext: { emails: [String?] in
            ...
        })
    ```
